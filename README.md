# Biomedical-Named-Entity-Recognition-Disease-Clustering

Abstract:
The large volume of biomedical literature necessitates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions for efficient knowledge extraction. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Cluster Analysis, targeting disease-related keywords extraction and relationship unveiling within biomedical texts. Leveraging state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT and ELECTRA, fine-tuned on biomedical data, our system achieved promising results, surpassing baseline metrics with an F1 score of 0.7. Our NER performance was promising, but our clustering analysis results were only modest improvements, indicating room for improvement in revealing hidden relationships between disease entities. This paper underscores the importance of continual refinement and exploration in tackling complex challenges within the biomedical domain.

Keywords: Biomedical Named Entity Recognition, NLP, BERT, ELECTRA, Cluster Analysis, F1 score, Disease Entities.
